A stellar stream is a trail of stars that orbit a host galaxy. Usually formed through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_stripping][tidal stripping]] of former [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy][dwarf galaxies]], stellar streams are composed of two distinct parts: a leading tail and a trailing tail.
